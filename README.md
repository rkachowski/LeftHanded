# LeftHanded
A spritebuilder game made for Berlin Mini Jam Feb 2015

It is the future, the year 201X. Things have changed.

The right handed rule the earth. All lefties have been denounced and eliminated. Only the right way remains.

But the resistance fights back...

You play as future David Bowie, famous future left handed musician and left handed rights (lefts) activist.

#The Game

You have broken into the museum of the bourgeoisie right handed scum. 

You must convert all the artifacts that praise the right handed (wrong handed) nature and make them ~~right~~ correct. Because left is the true right.

But you can only turn left (which is right).

You run through the museum flipping statues and trying to get to the exit whilst only turning left. So strong are your convictions that when faced with certain death or a right(wrong) turn, you choose death every time. 

Good luck agent Bowie
